\chapter{Future work}

The following item have been identified as future action items by the
UGST in the close future. Contributions are welcome, eventhough the
proposed algorithm implementations may not be in fully compliance with
the software tool guidelines:

\begin{Descr}{60mm}
\item[P.50, P.59]
        Reference implementations of the Artificial Speech and
        Artificial Conversational Speech. \\
\item[Channel models]
        Transmission channel models to be incorporated in the EID
        module, e.g. satellite, cellular, and IP transmission
        channels. \\
\item[Reference systems]
        Alternatives to the MNRU, e.g. T-reference, S-Reference,
        PMNRU, PMNRU). \\
\item[G.726 \& G.727 Annex A]
        linear-interfaced G.726 and G.727. \\
\item[Processing framework]
        A processing framework tool for the implementation of host
        laboratory functions. \\
\item[Stereo processing tool]
        Made more generic to cope with multichannel and higher bit resolution \\
