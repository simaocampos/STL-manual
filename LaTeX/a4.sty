% "a4" document style option.
% John Pavel, May 1987
%
% Redefines the \textheight and \topmargin for A4 paper, as opposed to US paper.

% \textwidth is not altered because A4 is narrower than US paper.
%
% \textheight is the height of text (including footnotes and figures, 
% excluding running head and foot).
%
% Adjusting \textheight will adjust position of the bottom of the page.
% Must preserve "(\textheight - \topskip) divides \baselineskip".
% \topskip always appears to be 10pt.
%
%
% Following Lamport's change to other style files on 24 Jun 86,
% changed to explicitly compute \textheight to avoid roundoff.  The
% value of the multiplier was calculated as the floor of the old
% \textheight minus \topskip, divided by \baselineskip for
% \normalsize.
% 
% 
%
\topmargin 0 pt     %    Nominal distance from top of paper to top of page
\ifcase \@ptsize
    % mods for 10 pt
    \textheight 53\baselineskip
\or % mods for 11 pt 
    \textheight 46\baselineskip
\or % mods for 12 pt
    \textheight 42\baselineskip
