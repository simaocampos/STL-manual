# STL-manual
STL manual source files

This folder contains the documentation for the ITU Software Tool Library (G.191) including the draft updates up to 2014 and correspond to the first release in the OpenITU/STL project.

Modifications to the modules that affect their behaviour as documentation for new tools need to be included in this folder.

Some observations:
- The STL manual is written in LaTeX, many times as a rewrite of some provided WinWord text. 
- Images used in the manual are kept as external files - expressed as embedable image formats such as (E)PS, JPG, PNG, etc
